Project Title: Evaluation Assignment - Service Showcase

Description:
This web project showcases a range of plumbing services using a visually appealing layout created with Tailwind CSS. The main section features a split background with dark purple on the top and light grey on the bottom, effectively highlighting the service cards. Each card includes a relevant FontAwesome icon, a title, a brief description of the service, and a call-to-action link for further exploration.
A key feature is the hover effect that allows the entire card to rotate 360 degrees, enhancing user interaction and engagement. The project demonstrates the use of modern web design practices, responsive design with Tailwind CSS, and the integration of iconography for better visual communication.

Technologies Used:
1.HTML
2.Tailwind CSS
3.FontAwesome for Icons
4.Custom CSS for animations
